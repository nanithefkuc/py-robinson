# Py-Robinson
A Python implementation of Robinson, a toy web rendering engine built by Matt Brubeck, following his great series [Let's build a browser engine!](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html).

**NOTE:** This implementation is currently not working! Me thinks its the layout part of the code that is not working, but I'll have to do more debugging.
